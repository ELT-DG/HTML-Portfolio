<h1>The Best Movies According to Erolyn</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies of All Time!!</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Mr. and Mrs. Smith</h3>
<p>This movie has the best of both worlds! It has action, and romance definitely a must watch</p>

<h3>Player's Club</h3>
<p>I love me a black movie from the 90's and this was one of them. Loved the characters and even though the storyline didn't make the most sense, I liked it</p>

<h3>Tarzan</h3>
<p>TBH I really liked the soundtrack</p>
